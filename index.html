           Well, our journey into the IB Program kicked off with the amazing Ms. Flaviah leading the way. She was the one who first introduced us to this whole new world. It was back in 2022 during one of Ms. Dayane's classes that the letters "IB" were first said. Honestly, it felt like some secret code at first – IB? What on earth was that supposed to mean? But as time rolled on, things started to make sense. Although it did take a while before the whole IB thing truly clicked for us.

You know what's wild? We are the pioneers, the ones who had to roll up our sleeves and help our school get that all-important IB approval. Talk about being pioneers! No other class will ever know the unique struggles and triumphs that come with being the Class of '24. We're in a league of our own!

            <div class="subtitles">How is it going?</div>
I cannot speak for everyone, however, I can tell you that is hard. We have so much on our plates that sometimes is tragic. Considering that we are teens and most of us have a social life, striking the balance between internal assessments, the extended essay, and the tok exhibition is not an easy task. For many moments we doubt if we are going to make it. Everything for the 45 right?            
           
            <div class="subtitles">What does the future wait for us?</div>
I have no clue. The fact is that every day the exams are getting closer and closer, and on the one hand is fantastic because it is finishing, but on the other hand is also really scary because it is finishing! We are in the “coming of age” era where all the certainties are not that certain anymore, and we are becoming grown people, so there is some sort of emotional limbo. Anyway, guys study and stay focused, we are almost there!
